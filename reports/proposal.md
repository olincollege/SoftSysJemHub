# “JemHub” GitHub Interpretation #

Elvis Wolcott, Jonas Kazlauskas, Miles Mezaki

### 1) Briefly, how was your experience with the last project? In light of that experience, what, if anything, will you do differently in this project? ###
Jonas
My previous experience was lonely. I did some stuff and it worked but it wasn’t super fun and I missed working with others. This project I want to work with partners so that I can have more fun and we can build something bigger.
Elvis:
Last project I enjoyed the teaming experience and final state we reached, but overall was disappointed that it wasn’t as involved/ambitious as I would have liked. Because it was very split up into separate pieces with minimal interaction, I didn’t have to collaborate directly as much as I would have liked. This structure also meant there wasn’t as much accountability so it was easier to procrastinate. I think with more accountability we could have made something much more advanced with all that we learned. This project I will be more proactive about organization and setting intermediate deadlines for progress.
Miles: My previous experience felt like it was artificial in that I was very unproductive and felt I didn’t learn as much as I could have. I wasn’t as motivated by the topic I was researching and programming, and realized that passion is very important to devoting time and effort to a programming project. I think having teammates will also be very constructive to both my learning and my work output as we will provide checks and balances for each other.

### 2) What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious. ###

Our goal is to make a git-like version control system. We hope to extend this MVP to add a way for multiple people to work on a repository, similar to github. Our lower bound is to create a software that allows us to create repositories and create commits on that repository, saving progress along the way. Our stretch goals are to add more advanced features in git such as branches and merging. We also want to add a way to sync repositories across a network.

### 3) What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project? ###

Jonas
I want to learn more about how git works and why it is such a widely used version control system. I also want to work on my overall C development skills such as creating make files, using libraries, and networking.
Miles
I want to learn more about how Git optimizes for storage space while still maintaining the existence of every previous version of a document. I would love to discover exactly how this is done. I also want to work with sockets and understand internet connections on a more fundamental level.
Elvis
I want to learn more about low level network programming and how to write robust networked programs that can deal with loss of connection and other errors. I also hope to build the skills necessary to effectively develop c software on a team and take advantage of git and make effectively to do so. I would like to improve my ability to test c programs thoroughly and especially consider how to do this best around networking code and distributed systems.

### 4) What do you need to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help? ### 

For us to be able to collaborate effectively, we need to create some overarching design documents that will govern what we all do.
We also plan to research the design of git to understand some of the design decisions they made and what the tradeoffs are. We expect these resources to be easy to find online.
We have already discovered some resources (linked below) that will help us start out.

### 5) What are your first steps?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you can do immediately, and identify which member of the team will do them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done? ###
Read Eric Sink’s web blog about version control, and research git. This task will be complete when we can each explain why git has become the general standard for CS.
Read Head First C, Chapter 11 (Sockets and Network Programming) - to demonstrate that they are done, we will briefly discuss what we learned, and perhaps do the homework.
Scaffold a locally hosted version control program on paper / miro. We will demonstrate the completion of this task by image, if necessary.
